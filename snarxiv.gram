# This grammar is free from context, and also free for you to use
# however you like, although it's probably not a good idea to try
# actually submitting any of these to the arXiv.  Feel free to suggest
# improvements or additions, particularly famous physicists or physics
# concepts with funny names that I forgot.
#
# The code grew organically over several hours, so it may be poorly
# organized, incomplete, and inconsistent.  Hopefully the output
# reflects that.
